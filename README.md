# Riddle Me This game

## Introduction

`Riddle Me This` is an open qiuz game web application that asks players to guess the answer to a text-based riddle.

You are not required to sign up. This project reflects a little bit of my attempt to create a quiz game for people to combine learning with a funn.

# UX

## Project Goals

The project demonstrate the ability to show all the learned during the module.
Showign the ability to deal with an API in JavaScript and get response back from JSON. 
JSON is essentially written as standard JavaScript object. To show that when I know how to use JavaScript object then I know how to use JSON.
